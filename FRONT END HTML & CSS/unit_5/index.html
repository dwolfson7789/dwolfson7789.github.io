    Hi! My name is Drew Alexander Wolfson, I am a New Yorker, born and raised. I live in Merrick, New York and am the youngest of 3 brothers. I love 90's rock and can listen to Nirvana all day long. I take guitar lessons at night and am a real concert-junkie. When I'm not at work, I catch up on my TV shows, play video games, read The Walking Dead comics and rep nerd life with pride. I love to travel and have seen the world, from Dubai to China. Sushi is my favorite food and breakfast is my favorite meal, so sometimes I eat sushi for breakfast. I've been gluten-free since I was 20 and miss real bagels more and more each day. I went to West Virginia University, where I triple majored. I went far away to experience a new way of life and a taste of the country. I graduated with a BA that constitutes a triple major in English, Public Relations and Communication Sutdies. I previously worked at Ernst & Young in their business development section and am currently Head of Development for Troy Curtis Entertainment. I love to learn in a creative enviorment and am excited to be given the power to build and create endless realms.
